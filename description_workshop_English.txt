NOTE: The author is a Chinese and his English sucks, so the next time when you want to submit some bug reports, please describe it with details as more as you can.

This is a vanity pet mod
The summon items are dropped from every boss with a 20% chance (or some enemies with a 1~25% chance), and it always drops the first time you defeat the Boss
Some items can be obtained by crafting
You can also buy these items from the Mysterious Gap which spawns in nighttime
